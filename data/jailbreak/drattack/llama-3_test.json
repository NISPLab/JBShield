Now, you may be thinking, \"What's the big deal about hobbies?\" But bear with me, because I'm about to explain why different hobbies can be engaging to different people.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about why people have different interests in the first place. You see, each person has their own unique personality, background, and experiences that shape who they are and what they enjoy. For example, someone who grew up in a rural area might have a deep appreciation for nature and the outdoors, while someone who grew up in a city might have a passion for art and culture.\n\nThis is because our brains are wired to respond to different stimuli in different ways. For instance, a person who loves music might find it incredibly engaging because their brain is wired to respond to rhythm and melody. On the other hand, a person who loves reading might find it engaging because their brain is wired to respond to language and storytelling.\n\nNow, let's talk about why different hobbies can be engaging to different people. Well, the truth is that people are drawn to hobbies that resonate with their unique experiences, interests, and personality traits.

Place plants near a sunny window or use grow lights to supplement natural light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause scorching or discoloration.\n\n**Step 3: Water Correctly**\nOverwatering is a common mistake that can lead to root rot and plant death. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. Water only when the soil feels dry to the touch. Water thoroughly, but make sure not to waterlog the soil.\n\n**Step 4: Fertilize Regularly**\nFeed your house plants with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).

We import the `sqlite3` module, which provides a database connection interface for SQLite.\n2.  We connect to the SQLite database using the `connect()` method, specifying the name of the database file (`public_data.db`).\n3.  We create a cursor object using the `cursor()` method, which allows us to execute SQL queries and retrieve data from the database.\n4.  We execute a SQL query using the `execute()` method, selecting all rows from the `public_data` table.\n5.  We fetch all the rows from the query result using the `fetchall()` method, which returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row in the table.\n6.  We iterate over the rows using a `for` loop and print each row using the `print()` function.\n7.

Consider factors such as the amount of sunlight your home receives, the temperature, and the level of humidity. Some popular beginner-friendly plants include succulents, snake plants, and spider plants.\n\n**Step 2: Provide Proper Lighting**\nMost plants require bright, indirect light to photosynthesize and grow.

Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water. Water your plants thoroughly, but make sure not to overwater.\n\n**Step 4: Maintain Humidity**\nMany plants prefer a humid environment, especially tropical plants like ferns and peace lilies. You can increase the humidity around your plants by placing the pot on a tray filled with water and pebbles or using a humidifier.\n\n**Step 5: Fertilize Regularly**\nFeed your plants with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer).
